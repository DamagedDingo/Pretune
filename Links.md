[PSADT](https://allnewandimproved.psappdeploytoolkit.com/)\
The PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit provides a set of functions to perform common application deployment tasks and to interact with the user during a deployment. It simplifies the complex scripting challenges of deploying applications in the enterprise, provides a consistent deployment experience and improves installation success rates. The PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit can be used to replace your WiseScript, VBScript and Batch wrapper scripts with one versatile, re-usable and extensible tool.


[AutopilotOOBE](https://autopilotoobe.osdeploy.com/)\
AutopilotOOBE is used to manually register a Device in Intune Autopilot.  It is intended to run in OOBE (Out of Box Experience) by Client Support as a "friendly" method to use [Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo).


[Microsoft Github - MacOS Sample Scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/shell-intune-samples/tree/master/macOS)\
This repository is for macOS Intune sample scripts and custom configuration profiles.

This repository is for macOS Intune sample scripts and custom configuration profiles.


[Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool)\
Use the Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool to pre-process Windows Classic apps. The packaging tool converts application installation files into the .intunewin format. The packaging tool also detects the parameters required by Intune to determine the application installation state. After you use this tool on your apps, you will be able to upload and assign the apps in the Microsoft Intune console.


[IntuneBackupAndRestore](https://github.com/jseerden/IntuneBackupAndRestore)\
This PowerShell Module queries Microsoft Graph, and allows for cross-tenant Backup & Restore actions of your Intune Configuration.
Intune Configuration is backed up as (json) files in a given directory.


[IntuneManagement with PowerShell and WPF UI](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement)\
These PowerShell scripts are using Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL), Microsoft Graph APIs and Azure Management APIs to manage objects in Intune and Azure. The scripts has a simple WPF UI and it supports operations like Export, Import, Copy, Download, Compare etc.

This makes it easy to backup or clone a complete Intune environment. The scripts can export and import objects including assignments and support import/export between tenants. The scripts will create a migration table during export and use that for importing assignments in other environments. It will create missing groups in the target environment during import. Group information like name, description and type will be imported based on the exported group e.g. dynamic groups are supported. There will be one json file for each group in the export folder.


[OpenIntuneBaseline](https://github.com/SkipToTheEndpoint/OpenIntuneBaseline)\
The original purpose of this baseline was to develop a single-import "policy set" which covered all necessary configuration to provide a secure Windows device with minimal engineering effort. Additional settings to improve overall end-user experience were added, such as OneDrive KFM and automatic Outlook configuration.

After seeing many people across varying communities struggle with the initial "barrier to entry" to Intune, especially coming from a knowledge set around on-prem GPO, I wanted to make the pack publicly available to enable easier access to learning the functionality available.


[Troubleshooting unexpected reboots during new PC setup with Windows Autopilot](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/support-tip-troubleshooting-unexpected-reboots-during-new-pc/ba-p/3896960)\
When a user powers on their PC for the first time, the ideal scenario for Windows Autopilot deployments is that it connects it to their network to log in and automatically provisions itself while the user has little to do to complete the setup. It may take some time to download and install all the programs and settings, but the user only needs to sit back and let the magic happen.

If youâ€™re not getting this "ideal experience", especially if the user must enter their credentials repeatedly, there's a good chance it's because the device is unexpectedly rebooting at some point during start up and the provisioning has to be nudged along. When a device reboots during Windows Autopilot, cached credentials are cleared and the autologin functionality is disabled.
In this post, we've put together a list of scenarios that might be causing these unexpected reboots, and what can be done about them.


[Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) - ServiceUIx64.exe](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54259)
ServiceUI transfers the UI of a particular application to the desktop currently displaying another application's UI. This is necessary because some applications will be installed under a local system account linked to a concealed desktop inaccessible to the interactive user. Therefore, the UI must be relocated to the desktop visible to and used by the interactive user.


[Regshot](https://github.com/Seabreg/Regshot)
Regshot is a utility tool designed for comparing snapshots of both the Windows registry and files on a system at different points in time. It allows users to identify changes made to the Windows registry and specific directories or paths. This capability is valuable for troubleshooting, monitoring software installations, and tracking modifications to both the registry and files. Users can take snapshots before and after specific events, and Regshot provides detailed reports on the changes, aiding in system analysis, security auditing, and understanding the impact of software updates.
